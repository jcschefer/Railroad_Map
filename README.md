# Railroad_Map
Used Google Maps to help visualize the benefits of the A* graph search

To view the map, run the python file called runme.py, this will run the A* and Dijkstra searches, print out a javascript file of coordinates, and then launch the map.

By default, the map will open in firefox, but this can be changed in the runme.py file.

This is made to be run from the command line on linux, other operating systems will most likely require tweaks to get it to run.
